			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>The aim of the European Continuous Improvement Circles Project (ECIC) is to disseminate participative<lb/> methods of organizational development originating from Scandinavian countries to the rest of Europe.<lb/> Examples for such methods are improvement circles where people come together to discuss a given<lb/> topic, for instance implications of new information technology for their workplace. A facilitator guides<lb/> this discussion process in order to attain agreed goals.<lb/></p>

			<p>Manuals on paper can give an introduction into such methods but sometimes they lack the capability to<lb/> convey the complex nature of such approaches. More interactive forms of representation like<lb/> hypermedia are probably more appropriate for participative methods. In addition, the ECIC project<lb/> consisted of several fairly similar methods strongly related to each other. Therefore, we decided that a<lb/> hypertext-based learning system might be a viable form of introducing this topic to European countries<lb/> not acquainted with such approaches. The potential learners of the ECIC methodologies are<lb/> representatives of business administration or Civil Service who often do not hold academic degrees. The<lb/> ECIC learning system has to be adapted to the needs of this user group. A thorough evaluation of the<lb/> learning systems is, therefore, necessary. The methods of ECIC can be seen as an ill-structured domain<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>, therefore it is the main interest of our usability study to verify the structural representation and the<lb/> user interface supporting the interpretations of the learner as an ongoing process.<lb/></p>

			<head>EVALUATION METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>The evaluation has several aims. The most important one is to find out how users navigated the learning<lb/> system. The ECIC methodologies are quite similar to each other and influence each other in their<lb/> development. Users should, therefore, get extensive information about the structure of the material to be<lb/> able to see similarities and differences of the different approaches. In this context, several aspects are<lb/> interesting. The learning system contains several pages with graphical overviews. We wanted to know<lb/> whether spatial visualization of information is effectively realized in our program. Dee-Lucas <ref type="biblio">[6]<lb/></ref> assumes that spatial visualization is especially important for these learners who compare the target<lb/> content and generate relationships that are not explicit in the text. Tosca <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> points out that the relevance<lb/> of links is the result of an ongoing interpretation process by the learner. To get information about this<lb/> process, we analyze whether users prefer some types of links above others and which links are more<lb/> understandable than others. We are also interested in how long learners examine single pages or nodes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The ECIC learning system tries to present the information in an interactive way. One of our questions is<lb/> whether users are motivated by interactive examples or not. If they engage in working with interactive<lb/> examples for an extended period of time this might be an indicator for the attractiveness for such pages.<lb/> An important variable is also whether texts are clear and understandable. A final question is what users<lb/> keep in mind when they have finished using the learning system and if their recollection is based on<lb/> specific representations in the program.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several methods of evaluating computer software <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref><ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. We chose a combination of thinking<lb/> aloud protocols and software logging. The thinking aloud protocols are supposed to convey data about<lb/> users&apos; attitudes towards the learning system and the motivation for their behavior. We have formulated<lb/> several short questions, which are based on our research interests formulated above. Users are asked to<lb/> keep these questions in mind while they work to focus their utterances. It is well-known that thinking<lb/> aloud protocols are a fairly disruptive form of investigation. Nevertheless, we find that this method<lb/> conveys information, which cannot be obtained otherwise, like, e.g. learners&apos; motivation for using or not<lb/> using specific links or graphical overview maps. In order to interpret correctly if a user stays at the same<lb/> topic during a long time, it is important to know whether the user finds the topic very interesting or very<lb/> confusing.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also developed a monitoring tool to log the users&apos; actions. This tool creates a log-file with information<lb/> about the duration of a session, the exact time when a page is accessed or left and the object, which is<lb/> used to leave a page.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Navigational Graph of the first 33 moves, users&apos; moves start at &quot;Contents&quot;, the moves are shown by the ascending<lb/> numbers next to the directed arrows; &quot;Map&quot; is a graphical overview map, &quot;Contents&quot; is the main content of ECIC learning<lb/> system, &quot;T_A&quot; to &quot;T_D&quot; stand for theme A to theme D which represent four different topics of ECIC.<lb/></p>

			<p>From these data we can infer whether users traverse the document hierarchically or in a sequential way<lb/> and whether they visited the graphical overviews or maps to a large extent. The monitoring tool also<lb/> provides information about how long users visit a specific node. Based on this information, a directed<lb/> graph can be constructed showing the moves of the user <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. McEneaney uses similar graphs to<lb/> visualize users&apos; behavior <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>If analysis of users&apos; behavior is only based on navigational log-files, wrong conclusions could be drawn.<lb/> Both methods -thinking aloud protocols and software logging -are supposed to complement one<lb/> another to give a more comprehensive view of learners&apos; behavior.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>So far, we have tested two persons who worked with the ECIC learning system. Those tests were very<lb/> extensive and yielded a large amount of data. During the test we also investigated whether the test<lb/> procedure we developed was viable or not. We realized, for example, that asking the users too many<lb/> questions during the test was rather disruptive. One (tentative) result of our evaluation is that the<lb/> graphical overviews played an important role for the subjects, although one of the two persons also<lb/> employed a sequential mode of browsing to a large extent. For both subjects, it was difficult at first to<lb/> adapt to the hypertextual form of organization of information. As expected, users spend very much time<lb/> examining pages with complex information. But Interactive examples engage users&apos; attention even when<lb/> they do not convey very much information. One user mentioned that some of the interactive examples in<lb/> the learning system gave him a more vivid impression of the method described. After the test we asked<lb/> the users to write down the most salient information they kept in mind. One of the subjects drew a<lb/> graphical map resembling the overview map in the program. The same person used the graphical<lb/> overview map of the ECIC learning system very frequently.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The evaluation of the ECIC learning system is an ongoing process. So far, we have data from two<lb/> subjects. These data indicate that graphical overviews or maps probably play an important role for<lb/> learner navigation. We intend to investigate several more subjects to get more representative results.<lb/> Furthermore, we want to develop a more systematic method of analysis for the thinking aloud protocols<lb/> and for the directed graphs representing the learners&apos; paths through the document.</p>
