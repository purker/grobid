			<head>1 INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Visual Computing helps for many applications, often it provides visual solutions to data<lb/> intensive problems. However, academic research often solves problems suspected by the<lb/> researchers, rather than problems that appear in industry. The VRVis Research Center is set up<lb/> to solve real problems from the real world, which is mostly less spectacular in the pure scientific<lb/> sense, but it leads to practically useable results. This sort of research is not less demanding,<lb/> however seen as second class research by many academics. For the researchers themselves it is<lb/> rather more difficult than academic research, because the goal cannot be changed to avoid<lb/> complications. In addition, VRVis researchers need to have numerous other &quot;non academic<lb/> qualifications&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 THE VRVis RESEARCH CENTER<lb/></head>

			<p>The VRVis Competence Center <ref type="biblio">(VRVis 2014)</ref> was founded in 2000 funded by the Austrian<lb/> Kplus program, and since 2010 it is funded by the Austrian COMET program as a K1 center. Its<lb/> mission is to perform research and development in Visual Computing and bridge the gap<lb/> between science and industry with translational research. VRVis is located in the TechGate<lb/> building in Vienna, Austria, and has an annual budget of around 5 million Euros from which<lb/> mainly around 65 researchers are paid.<lb/></p>

			<p>The VRVis Research Center is set up as a non-profit-making limited company which is owned<lb/> by universities and many companies. Currently VRVis is organized in three areas, which are<lb/> Rendering, Visualization, and Visual Analytics. Each area performs some five to ten projects,<lb/> most of which are multi-firm projects, that means that more than one company contributes to its<lb/> budget.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 THE UNDERSTANDING OF INNOVATION<lb/></head>

			<p>In theory there is a common understanding how innovation happens. Scientists and researchers<lb/> investigate the unexplored world and produce publically accessible publications and patents.<lb/> This process is mostly done at universities and public research institutions. Then developers in<lb/> companies make use of these findings and results to produce solutions for the real world, stable<lb/> products for the world market. In large companies often additional research is added, the results<lb/> of which are mostly protected by patents immediately, or they are kept secret altogether.<lb/></p>

			<p>In practice this innovation chain rarely happens that way. The research results from academics<lb/> have assumed ideal conditions, non-realistic constraints and flawless input data, so that an<lb/> additional step is necessary to adapt such results to realistic requirements. This step is larger<lb/> than many scientists are aware of, and it justifies specialized translational research institutions<lb/> such as VRVis, AIT, Fraunhofer, and others. In close cooperation with developers from<lb/> companies, these institutions have the competence to adapt pure research results to the<lb/> requirements of the real world, and the people working there need special skills to perform these<lb/> tasks.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH STAFF<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to the necessity to perform first class project work, i.e. to meet the defined project<lb/> goals, researchers at a translational research institution such as VRVis need to be able to cope<lb/> with a variety of additional challenges. These are partly due to the real life conditions, and<lb/> partly because the overall requirements exceed those of pure research.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Communication with Real Users<lb/></head>

			<p>Dealing with people from outside the field of computer science uncovers the use of different<lb/> languages for the same things, and the complexity of some aspects that seem simple for the<lb/> computer scientist. Often the user describes a problem and her/his envisaged solution in the<lb/> idealistic world of her/his realm. The project leader misunderstands parts, and adds new ideas<lb/> based on her/his knowledge of technical possibilities. The programmer interprets these<lb/> requirements based on her/his personal experience and attitudes and produces something the<lb/> user believes is wrong. Only during this last discussion it turns out that the first description by<lb/> the user was incomplete, the interpretation by the project leader went in the wrong direction and<lb/> the creativity of the programmer (and possible errors in the code) produced an unusable result.<lb/> Coping with this situation is a challenge in its own. In addition some users misunderstand the<lb/> options and possibilities, and also all users (and scientists, of course) are different characters,<lb/> that don&apos;t always fit together.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Use of Real Data<lb/></head>

			<p>Idealized test data are always created optimally so that the foreseen variations of an algorithm<lb/> work fine. Data from the real world is erroneous, incomplete, inexact, includes many exceptions<lb/> to the defined rules, and, above all that, is often huge, much larger than the algorithm was<lb/> intended for. Especially the adaptation of functioning and published state-of-the-art algorithms<lb/> to extreme data sizes is a main research topic for VRVis researchers.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Hardware and Market Knowledge<lb/></head>

			<p>Researchers operating under realistic conditions need to be experts with all the various hardware<lb/> they use. Many fast algorithms have to be implemented with hardware dependent components<lb/> to ensure low level optimization. Today not only the large amount of companies creates many<lb/> different interfaces, but also the immense variety of special hardware components. To make<lb/> optimal use of these, it is also necessary to keep an overview over new product developments,<lb/> hardware trends and announced products. Visiting technical exhibitions and fairs, reading<lb/> computer journals and watching announcements in electronic media are necessary and expected<lb/> activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4 Project Initiation and Proposal Writing<lb/></head>

			<p>New projects don&apos;t come by themselves. VRVis researchers are also experts in generating new<lb/> projects. They need to be aware of all funding opportunities and know how to write a successful<lb/> funding proposal. Based on intensive contacts with many companies they must also<lb/> communicate the functioning of a translational research institution to these. For the proposals<lb/> they need to be aware of the state-of-the-art of their science field and of the intended application<lb/> field. They have to be trained in project planning, including time and budget plans. And they<lb/> have to be experienced and consequent to collect the proposal parts the company partners have<lb/> to deliver in time!<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5 Scientific Publishing<lb/></head>

			<p>Evaluators of any research institution are often pure academic researchers. Their main<lb/> evaluation criterion is then scientific output, i.e. the number and quality of produced scientific<lb/> publications. Therefore, VRVis researchers have to fully understand this aspect and be able to<lb/> write scientific publications that will be accepted at high quality media. This includes knowing<lb/> where to publish, knowing the scientific state-of-the-art, and giving good talks at conferences.<lb/> But it is also a challenge to get the o.k. from companies to publish at all, and to judge any con-<lb/>flicts such a publication might have with patents or other intellectual property rights involved.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.6. Professional Documentation<lb/></head>

			<p>As opposed to usual scientific results which are produced for one time demonstration of the<lb/> correctness of a result, software or system components intended for practical use need to be<lb/> accompanied by understandable and complete documentation and user manuals. In addition,<lb/> companies involved in a project often require training sessions for the people who either will<lb/> use the results or who are involved in strategic decisions at the company. Thus it is necessary<lb/> that the programmers and project leader maintain the user view of their products -not always<lb/> easy when you are deep into the details.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.7 Multi-tasking under Time Pressure<lb/></head>

			<p>Projects for the real world also have real deadlines. University scientists are used to extendible<lb/> deadlines, flexible result progress, and no concrete consequences in case they miss these. Only<lb/> submission deadlines at conferences generate some stress, but again, no severe consequences<lb/> other than postponing the result to the next available publication option occur. In contrast, when<lb/> cooperating with companies there are project contracts, fixed deadlines and there is little<lb/> compromise accepted for the results. This increased time stress is accompanied by nervous<lb/> roommates, noise, telephone calls, emails, reviews, guests, continued education, project<lb/> initiations, and many more disturbing factors. It needs special concentration to be able to work<lb/> under such conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Translational research is a challenge in its own, often underestimated by academic scientific<lb/> staff. Besides excellence in computer science involved researchers need to have various<lb/> valuable skills not taught in usual university courses. Thus the value of a research organization<lb/> depends even more on its well selected employees and the relevant skills learned on the job than<lb/> on any other aspect.</p>
