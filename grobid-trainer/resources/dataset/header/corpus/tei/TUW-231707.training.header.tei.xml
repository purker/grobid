	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT: The VRVis Research Center in Vienna is the largest technology transfer<lb/> institution in the area of Visual Computing in Austria. The requirements of the funding body<lb/> FFG include the publication of scientific research results in first class peer reviewed media, and<lb/> the active cooperation with co-funding companies. As a consequence the requirements on the<lb/> staff of VRVis are manifold: they have to communicate with real users, use real data, know<lb/> about software and hardware, understand the market, do professional documentation, initiate<lb/> new projects and write funding proposals for these, be part of the scientific community and<lb/> publish and review papers, manage several projects in parallel and obey strict deadlines for their<lb/> projects and some more. Such staff is barely available and must be trained on the job.</div>
