			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The aim of the European Continuous Improvement Circles Project (ECIC) is to disseminate participative <lb/>methods of organizational development originating from Scandinavian countries to the rest of Europe. <lb/>Examples for such methods are improvement circles where people come together to discuss a given <lb/>topic, for instance implications of new information technology for their workplace. A facilitator guides <lb/>this discussion process in order to attain agreed goals. <lb/>Manuals on paper can give an introduction into such methods but sometimes they lack the capability to <lb/>convey the complex nature of such approaches. More interactive forms of representation like <lb/>hypermedia are probably more appropriate for participative methods. In addition, the ECIC project <lb/>consisted of several fairly similar methods strongly related to each other. Therefore, we decided that a <lb/>hypertext-based learning system might be a viable form of introducing this topic to European countries <lb/>not acquainted with such approaches. The potential learners of the ECIC methodologies are <lb/>representatives of business administration or Civil Service who often do not hold academic degrees. The <lb/>ECIC learning system has to be adapted to the needs of this user group. A thorough evaluation of the <lb/>learning systems is, therefore, necessary. The methods of ECIC can be seen as an ill-structured domain <lb/>[1], therefore it is the main interest of our usability study to verify the structural representation and the <lb/>user interface supporting the interpretations of the learner as an ongoing process. <lb/>EVALUATION METHODS <lb/>The evaluation has several aims. The most important one is to find out how users navigated the learning <lb/>system. The ECIC methodologies are quite similar to each other and influence each other in their <lb/>development. Users should, therefore, get extensive information about the structure of the material to be <lb/>able to see similarities and differences of the different approaches. In this context, several aspects are <lb/>interesting. The learning system contains several pages with graphical overviews. We wanted to know <lb/>whether spatial visualization of information is effectively realized in our program. Dee-Lucas [6] <lb/>assumes that spatial visualization is especially important for these learners who compare the target <lb/>content and generate relationships that are not explicit in the text. Tosca [4] points out that the relevance <lb/>of links is the result of an ongoing interpretation process by the learner. To get information about this <lb/>process, we analyze whether users prefer some types of links above others and which links are more <lb/>understandable than others. We are also interested in how long learners examine single pages or nodes. <lb/>The ECIC learning system tries to present the information in an interactive way. One of our questions is <lb/>whether users are motivated by interactive examples or not. If they engage in working with interactive <lb/>examples for an extended period of time this might be an indicator for the attractiveness for such pages. <lb/>An important variable is also whether texts are clear and understandable. A final question is what users <lb/>keep in mind when they have finished using the learning system and if their recollection is based on <lb/>specific representations in the program. <lb/>There are several methods of evaluating computer software [3][5]. We chose a combination of thinking <lb/>aloud protocols and software logging. The thinking aloud protocols are supposed to convey data about <lb/>users&apos; attitudes towards the learning system and the motivation for their behavior. We have formulated <lb/>several short questions, which are based on our research interests formulated above. Users are asked to <lb/>keep these questions in mind while they work to focus their utterances. It is well-known that thinking <lb/>aloud protocols are a fairly disruptive form of investigation. Nevertheless, we find that this method <lb/>conveys information, which cannot be obtained otherwise, like, e.g. learners&apos; motivation for using or not <lb/>using specific links or graphical overview maps. In order to interpret correctly if a user stays at the same <lb/>topic during a long time, it is important to know whether the user finds the topic very interesting or very <lb/>confusing. <lb/>We also developed a monitoring tool to log the users&apos; actions. This tool creates a log-file with information <lb/>about the duration of a session, the exact time when a page is accessed or left and the object, which is <lb/>used to leave a page. <lb/>Figure 1: Navigational Graph of the first 33 moves, users&apos; moves start at &quot;Contents&quot;, the moves are shown by the ascending <lb/>numbers next to the directed arrows; &quot;Map&quot; is a graphical overview map, &quot;Contents&quot; is the main content of ECIC learning <lb/>system, &quot;T_A&quot; to &quot;T_D&quot; stand for theme A to theme D which represent four different topics of ECIC. <lb/>From these data we can infer whether users traverse the document hierarchically or in a sequential way <lb/>and whether they visited the graphical overviews or maps to a large extent. The monitoring tool also <lb/>provides information about how long users visit a specific node. Based on this information, a directed <lb/>graph can be constructed showing the moves of the user (Fig. 1). McEneaney uses similar graphs to <lb/>visualize users&apos; behavior [2]. <lb/>If analysis of users&apos; behavior is only based on navigational log-files, wrong conclusions could be drawn. <lb/>Both methods -thinking aloud protocols and software logging -are supposed to complement one <lb/>another to give a more comprehensive view of learners&apos; behavior. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>So far, we have tested two persons who worked with the ECIC learning system. Those tests were very <lb/>extensive and yielded a large amount of data. During the test we also investigated whether the test <lb/>procedure we developed was viable or not. We realized, for example, that asking the users too many <lb/>questions during the test was rather disruptive. One (tentative) result of our evaluation is that the <lb/>graphical overviews played an important role for the subjects, although one of the two persons also <lb/>employed a sequential mode of browsing to a large extent. For both subjects, it was difficult at first to <lb/>adapt to the hypertextual form of organization of information. As expected, users spend very much time <lb/>examining pages with complex information. But Interactive examples engage users&apos; attention even when <lb/>they do not convey very much information. One user mentioned that some of the interactive examples in <lb/>the learning system gave him a more vivid impression of the method described. After the test we asked <lb/>the users to write down the most salient information they kept in mind. One of the subjects drew a <lb/>graphical map resembling the overview map in the program. The same person used the graphical <lb/>overview map of the ECIC learning system very frequently. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>The evaluation of the ECIC learning system is an ongoing process. So far, we have data from two <lb/>subjects. These data indicate that graphical overviews or maps probably play an important role for <lb/>learner navigation. We intend to investigate several more subjects to get more representative results. <lb/>Furthermore, we want to develop a more systematic method of analysis for the thinking aloud protocols <lb/>and for the directed graphs representing the learners&apos; paths through the document. <lb/></body>
