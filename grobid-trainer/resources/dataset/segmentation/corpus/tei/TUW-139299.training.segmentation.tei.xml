			<front>Interactive Visualization of Time-Oriented Treatment Plans and <lb/>Patient Data <lb/>THESIS SUMMARY <lb/>Wolfgang Aigner <lb/>March 15, 2004 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>This thesis presents methods to support protocol-based care in medicine. Time-oriented treat-<lb/>ment plans and patient data are represented visually providing various interaction possibilities to aid <lb/>execution and analysis of medical therapy plans formulated in the representation language Asbru. <lb/>We introduce a two-view approach consisting of a Logical View and a Temporal View. The Logical <lb/>View depicts therapy plans using a flow-chart like representation based on &quot;clinical algorithm maps&quot;. <lb/>The Temporal View on the other hand depicts plans as well as patient data in form of parameters <lb/>and variables over time. The plan visualization method within the Temporal View is based on the <lb/>idea of LifeLines. For being able to depict hierarchical structures and temporal uncertainties, we <lb/>extended this concept and a novel glyph called PlanningLine has been developed. <lb/>The development is embedded into a 3-step evaluation process including a user study with eight <lb/>domain experts (physicians) at the beginning to acquire users&apos; needs, a design evaluation, and an <lb/>evaluation of our software prototype at the end of the thesis project. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The use of clinical guidelines and treatment plans has a profound history in the medical field and is <lb/>widely used. The purpose of such representations and documents is primarily to enable discussion <lb/>and communication among medical staff (physicians, nursing personnel, etc.) as well as improving the <lb/>quality of care by setting up certain &quot;standard procedures&quot;. <lb/>Most clinical guidelines are represented in plain text, rarely including tables and flow-charts. Com-<lb/>puter support is desirable for various reasons: First of all obviously to ease document exchange, editing, <lb/>and reuse. Furthermore, due to the semiformal structure of such documents, taking it a step further <lb/>towards creation, runtime, and analysis support introduces a much higher level of aid. Tool support <lb/>in this sense helps to cope with ongoing information overflow, eases quality assessment, and facilitates <lb/>information respectively knowledge exchange. Clinical guidelines and protocols can be seen as skeletal <lb/>plans as used in some planning approaches. <lb/>Planning techniques are well known in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Various approaches and <lb/>solutions to solve planning problems have been carried out by the AI-, respectively planning community <lb/>since the 1960s. But most of these techniques can only be applied to well defined and limited problems. <lb/>The real-world domain medicine requires much more flexibility: Well defined problems and processes <lb/>are the exception rather than the rule, and uncertainty is an important factor. Traditional planning <lb/>approaches are not able to support these requirements. Therefore, special techniques for medical plan <lb/>management, like the Asgaard/Asbru [Miksch, 1999] approach (this work is part of) and others [Wang <lb/>et al., 2001], have been carried out. <lb/>Most of the scientific projects dealing with medical treatment planning concentrate on the knowledge <lb/>representation and acquisition as well as the implementation of that knowledge in real world environ-<lb/>ments. From a human-machine point of view, they focus almost entirely on the &quot;machine end&quot; of the <lb/>human-machine chain. Very little work has been carried out to bridge the gap between the formal AI <lb/>methods used &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and real consumers: physicians, nursing and other medical person-<lb/>nel. This work is intended to fill this gap. It aids physicians during plan execution by providing an <lb/>easy-to-use, intuitive interface approach towards medical treatment planning, starting from the user&apos;s <lb/>point of view. <lb/></body>

			<body>The top level goals of this thesis are to: <lb/>• provide a considerable treatment documentation, <lb/>• offer better analysis support by using appropriate visualization methods, <lb/>• merge various information sources, <lb/>• improve therapy, and <lb/>• help to concentrate on the essentials in the daily routine. <lb/>These goals represent vital improvements and advantages for the work process of physicians. <lb/>2 The Plan Representation Language Asbru <lb/>The underlying plan representation language used for this work is Asbru [Seyfang et al., 2002, Miksch <lb/>et al., 1997] which is a time-oriented, intention-based, skeletal plan-specification representation language <lb/>that is used in the Asgaard Project to represent clinical guidelines and protocols. <lb/>Visualizing Asbru plans imposes six fundamental problem characteristics on the representation that <lb/>have to be considered: <lb/>• time-oriented data from the past to future planning data including a rich set of time attributes <lb/>allowing to depict uncertainties <lb/>• logical sequences <lb/>• hierarchical decomposition <lb/>• flexible execution order (sequential, parallel, unordered, any-order) <lb/>• non-uniform element types <lb/>• state characteristics of conditions <lb/>Based on the identified basic issues, we investigated related work in medical treatment planning, <lb/>information visualization, medicine, and commercial medical software products. <lb/>3 Related Work <lb/>The related work presented here is only a part of the state-of-the-art research carried out in this thesis, <lb/>but represents the most important and most influential ones: <lb/>There is a number of scientific projects dealing with protocol based care in medicine present (see <lb/>[Peleg et al., 2003, www.openclinical.org, 2003]), but only some of these projects provide graphical tools <lb/>at all, and most of them only for authoring plans. They use a flowchart-or workflow-like presentation <lb/>depicting the elements used in their formal representation. <lb/>The most widely used visual representation of clinical guidelines in the medical domain are so-called <lb/>flow-chart algorithms also known as clinical algorithm maps [Hadorn, 1995,Society for Medical Decision <lb/>Making, 1992]. But these clinical algorithm maps were intended to be used on paper only and have <lb/>never been enriched by computer support as for example navigation or versatile annotation possibilities. <lb/>Furthermore, flow-charts cannot straightforwardly be used to represent temporal data, concurrent tasks, <lb/>or the complex conditions used in Asbru. <lb/>A simple and intuitive information visualization technique representing processes respectively states <lb/>over time are so called &quot;Life Lines&quot; [Plaisant et al., 1998] which have previously been used to depict <lb/>patient histories. <lb/>Because none of the existing visualization methods fulfilled all the requirements defined, we framed <lb/>out a new conceptual design. <lb/></body>

			<body>4 Design and Implementation <lb/>We took a two-view approach introducing a Logical View and a Temporal View for representing plans, <lb/>parameters, and variables (see Fig. 1). For the Logical View we created a flowchart-like representation <lb/>based on clinical algorithm maps. For depicting plans within the Temporal View, we extended the <lb/>LifeLine concept and developed a novel glyph called PlanningLine. A PlanningLine is able to represent <lb/>incidents having temporal uncertainties. Moreover, this glyph is not limited to the medical domain, but <lb/>can be used for a variety of applications. <lb/>Figure 1: Application window showing the execution of a plan (Mockup). <lb/>In order to proof our concept and give as well as get a better impression especially of interaction <lb/>issues, we implemented a Java prototype. For displaying the flowchart-like part of our representa-<lb/>tion to depict plan step elements, we use the graph drawing framework JGraph [Alder, 2002a, Alder, <lb/>2002b]. This is a flexible, small, and powerful package using the Model-View-Controller paradigm and <lb/>is structured analogous to the standard Swing component javax.swing.JTree. <lb/>5 User Involvement <lb/>We applied a user-centric approach when developing our visual representation: We involved real con-<lb/>sumers from the very beginning by carrying out a user study and evaluated our design as well as <lb/>our prototype thoroughly. This increases the quality of design, the user acceptance, and serves as an <lb/>indicator of the maturity of development. <lb/>The first step of major importance for requirement analysis in our development process was to con-<lb/>duct a user study with eight physicians to gain deeper insights into the medical domain, work practices, <lb/>application of guidelines in daily work, users&apos; needs, expectations, and imaginations. When summariz-<lb/>ing and evaluating the results of our user study the following desired fundamental characteristics can be <lb/>recognized: a simple and transparent structure, intuitive interaction (easy to learn and comprehend), <lb/>a cleaned up interface, a high level of application safety (undo where possible), time saving (allowing <lb/>quick and effective work), fast, and flexible. <lb/>We have examined and proven the usefulness of our two-view approach (Logical View and Temporal <lb/>View) by performing a 3-step evaluation process including the user study, design evaluation, and <lb/>prototype evaluation as described in detail in Chapters 7 and 8 of the thesis. <lb/></body>

			<body>6 Conclusion <lb/>The use of software in contrast to paper allows us to support the process of exploring and understanding <lb/>treatment plans at a higher level. It enables a meaningful navigation, providing annotations on demand <lb/>for not overwhelming the viewer, and keeping orientation by using Focus + Context techniques, thus <lb/>increasing the flexibility in working with treatment plans. The interaction is carried out intuitively <lb/>by applying well known techniques from standard software supported by different Focus + Context <lb/>techniques for keeping an overview. The most important user requirement of being time-saving is <lb/>achieved by combining intuitive navigation and rich information presentation including annotations <lb/>and linked documents in a structured way. This is in contrast to working with paper-based treatment <lb/>protocols that are often a mix of text, tables, and graphics, scattered over various pages, making it hard <lb/>to keep an overview and conceive the logic of a guideline. <lb/>An additional value besides communicating plans to domain experts became apparent during devel-<lb/>opment: The visualization of plans helps to spot problems, bugs, and ambiguities in the formal plan <lb/>representation which are hard to see and detect otherwise. Furthermore, the visualization serves as an <lb/>important basis for the communication between medical domain experts and computer scientists. <lb/></body>
