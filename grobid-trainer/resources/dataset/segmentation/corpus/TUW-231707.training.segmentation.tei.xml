			<front>Requirements on the Staff of an Application Oriented Research <lb/>Organization <lb/>Werner Purgathofer <lb/>Vienna University of Technology, 1040 Wien, Karlsplatz 13, Austria <lb/>&amp; VRVis Research Center, 1220 Wien, Donau-City-Straße 1, Austria <lb/>ABSTRACT: The VRVis Research Center in Vienna is the largest technology transfer <lb/>institution in the area of Visual Computing in Austria. The requirements of the funding body <lb/>FFG include the publication of scientific research results in first class peer reviewed media, and <lb/>the active cooperation with co-funding companies. As a consequence the requirements on the <lb/>staff of VRVis are manifold: they have to communicate with real users, use real data, know <lb/>about software and hardware, understand the market, do professional documentation, initiate <lb/>new projects and write funding proposals for these, be part of the scientific community and <lb/>publish and review papers, manage several projects in parallel and obey strict deadlines for their <lb/>projects and some more. Such staff is barely available and must be trained on the job. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 INTRODUCTION <lb/>Visual Computing helps for many applications, often it provides visual solutions to data <lb/>intensive problems. However, academic research often solves problems suspected by the <lb/>researchers, rather than problems that appear in industry. The VRVis Research Center is set up <lb/>to solve real problems from the real world, which is mostly less spectacular in the pure scientific <lb/>sense, but it leads to practically useable results. This sort of research is not less demanding, <lb/>however seen as second class research by many academics. For the researchers themselves it is <lb/>rather more difficult than academic research, because the goal cannot be changed to avoid <lb/>complications. In addition, VRVis researchers need to have numerous other &quot;non academic <lb/>qualifications&quot;. <lb/>2 THE VRVis RESEARCH CENTER <lb/>The VRVis Competence Center (VRVis 2014) was founded in 2000 funded by the Austrian <lb/>Kplus program, and since 2010 it is funded by the Austrian COMET program as a K1 center. Its <lb/>mission is to perform research and development in Visual Computing and bridge the gap <lb/>between science and industry with translational research. VRVis is located in the TechGate <lb/>building in Vienna, Austria, and has an annual budget of around 5 million Euros from which <lb/>mainly around 65 researchers are paid. <lb/>The VRVis Research Center is set up as a non-profit-making limited company which is owned <lb/>by universities and many companies. Currently VRVis is organized in three areas, which are <lb/>Rendering, Visualization, and Visual Analytics. Each area performs some five to ten projects, <lb/>most of which are multi-firm projects, that means that more than one company contributes to its <lb/>budget. <lb/>3 THE UNDERSTANDING OF INNOVATION <lb/>In theory there is a common understanding how innovation happens. Scientists and researchers <lb/>investigate the unexplored world and produce publically accessible publications and patents. <lb/>This process is mostly done at universities and public research institutions. Then developers in <lb/>companies make use of these findings and results to produce solutions for the real world, stable <lb/>products for the world market. In large companies often additional research is added, the results <lb/>of which are mostly protected by patents immediately, or they are kept secret altogether. <lb/>In practice this innovation chain rarely happens that way. The research results from academics <lb/>have assumed ideal conditions, non-realistic constraints and flawless input data, so that an <lb/>additional step is necessary to adapt such results to realistic requirements. This step is larger <lb/>than many scientists are aware of, and it justifies specialized translational research institutions <lb/>such as VRVis, AIT, Fraunhofer, and others. In close cooperation with developers from <lb/>companies, these institutions have the competence to adapt pure research results to the <lb/>requirements of the real world, and the people working there need special skills to perform these <lb/>tasks. <lb/>4 REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH STAFF <lb/>In addition to the necessity to perform first class project work, i.e. to meet the defined project <lb/>goals, researchers at a translational research institution such as VRVis need to be able to cope <lb/>with a variety of additional challenges. These are partly due to the real life conditions, and <lb/>partly because the overall requirements exceed those of pure research. <lb/>4.1 Communication with Real Users <lb/>Dealing with people from outside the field of computer science uncovers the use of different <lb/>languages for the same things, and the complexity of some aspects that seem simple for the <lb/>computer scientist. Often the user describes a problem and her/his envisaged solution in the <lb/>idealistic world of her/his realm. The project leader misunderstands parts, and adds new ideas <lb/>based on her/his knowledge of technical possibilities. The programmer interprets these <lb/>requirements based on her/his personal experience and attitudes and produces something the <lb/>user believes is wrong. Only during this last discussion it turns out that the first description by <lb/>the user was incomplete, the interpretation by the project leader went in the wrong direction and <lb/>the creativity of the programmer (and possible errors in the code) produced an unusable result. <lb/>Coping with this situation is a challenge in its own. In addition some users misunderstand the <lb/>options and possibilities, and also all users (and scientists, of course) are different characters, <lb/>that don&apos;t always fit together. <lb/>4.2 Use of Real Data <lb/>Idealized test data are always created optimally so that the foreseen variations of an algorithm <lb/>work fine. Data from the real world is erroneous, incomplete, inexact, includes many exceptions <lb/>to the defined rules, and, above all that, is often huge, much larger than the algorithm was <lb/>intended for. Especially the adaptation of functioning and published state-of-the-art algorithms <lb/>to extreme data sizes is a main research topic for VRVis researchers. <lb/>4.3 Hardware and Market Knowledge <lb/>Researchers operating under realistic conditions need to be experts with all the various hardware <lb/>they use. Many fast algorithms have to be implemented with hardware dependent components <lb/>to ensure low level optimization. Today not only the large amount of companies creates many <lb/>different interfaces, but also the immense variety of special hardware components. To make <lb/>optimal use of these, it is also necessary to keep an overview over new product developments, <lb/>hardware trends and announced products. Visiting technical exhibitions and fairs, reading <lb/>computer journals and watching announcements in electronic media are necessary and expected <lb/>activities. <lb/>4.4 Project Initiation and Proposal Writing <lb/>New projects don&apos;t come by themselves. VRVis researchers are also experts in generating new <lb/>projects. They need to be aware of all funding opportunities and know how to write a successful <lb/>funding proposal. Based on intensive contacts with many companies they must also <lb/>communicate the functioning of a translational research institution to these. For the proposals <lb/>they need to be aware of the state-of-the-art of their science field and of the intended application <lb/>field. They have to be trained in project planning, including time and budget plans. And they <lb/>have to be experienced and consequent to collect the proposal parts the company partners have <lb/>to deliver in time! <lb/>4.5 Scientific Publishing <lb/>Evaluators of any research institution are often pure academic researchers. Their main <lb/>evaluation criterion is then scientific output, i.e. the number and quality of produced scientific <lb/>publications. Therefore, VRVis researchers have to fully understand this aspect and be able to <lb/>write scientific publications that will be accepted at high quality media. This includes knowing <lb/>where to publish, knowing the scientific state-of-the-art, and giving good talks at conferences. <lb/>But it is also a challenge to get the o.k. from companies to publish at all, and to judge any con-<lb/>flicts such a publication might have with patents or other intellectual property rights involved. <lb/>4.6. Professional Documentation <lb/>As opposed to usual scientific results which are produced for one time demonstration of the <lb/>correctness of a result, software or system components intended for practical use need to be <lb/>accompanied by understandable and complete documentation and user manuals. In addition, <lb/>companies involved in a project often require training sessions for the people who either will <lb/>use the results or who are involved in strategic decisions at the company. Thus it is necessary <lb/>that the programmers and project leader maintain the user view of their products -not always <lb/>easy when you are deep into the details. <lb/>4.7 Multi-tasking under Time Pressure <lb/>Projects for the real world also have real deadlines. University scientists are used to extendible <lb/>deadlines, flexible result progress, and no concrete consequences in case they miss these. Only <lb/>submission deadlines at conferences generate some stress, but again, no severe consequences <lb/>other than postponing the result to the next available publication option occur. In contrast, when <lb/>cooperating with companies there are project contracts, fixed deadlines and there is little <lb/>compromise accepted for the results. This increased time stress is accompanied by nervous <lb/>roommates, noise, telephone calls, emails, reviews, guests, continued education, project <lb/>initiations, and many more disturbing factors. It needs special concentration to be able to work <lb/>under such conditions. <lb/>5 CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Translational research is a challenge in its own, often underestimated by academic scientific <lb/>staff. Besides excellence in computer science involved researchers need to have various <lb/>valuable skills not taught in usual university courses. Thus the value of a research organization <lb/>depends even more on its well selected employees and the relevant skills learned on the job than <lb/>on any other aspect. <lb/></body>
